        <h4 class ="WILFRED"> WILFRED</h4>
              <p>Haven't you anything to say to me?</p>
          
           <h4 class="PHOEBE"> PHOEBE </h4>
                     <P>Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
                      littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
                      in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
                      comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
                      ready for work? Ugh! you brute!</P>
          
           <h4 class = "WILFRED"> WILFRED</h4>  
                     <P> These allusions to my professional duties are in
                      doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
                      I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
                      tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
                      can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
                      Ah! you brought that upon yourself.</P>
          
           <h4 class= "PHOEBE"> PHOEBE</h4>
                    <P>  Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
                      science and an alchemist.</P>
          
           <h4 class = "WILFRED"> WILFRED</h4>       
                     <P> Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
                      he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
                      devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
                      fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                      Tower.</P>
          
           <h4 class= "PHOEBE"> PHOEBE</h4>  
                     <P> Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
                      take care; there's still time for a reply to his
                      petition for mercy.</P>

           <h4 class = "WILFRED"> WILFRED</h4> 
                     <p> Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
                      past sevenâ€” ah!</p>
