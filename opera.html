                                         Phoebe
          
            PHOEBE              When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                                     She wanders to and fro;
                                Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                                And to all questions she replies,
                                     With a sad "Heigh-ho!"
          
                                'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                                So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                                     An idle breath—
                                     Yet life and death
                                May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"
          
                                When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                                     As owl mopes on a tree;
                                Although she keenly feels the smart,
                                She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                                     With its sad "Ah, me!"
          
                                'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                                Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                                     Yet all the sense
                                     Of eloquence
                                Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
          
                                     Yet all the sense
                                     Of eloquence

                                     "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"
          
                                     Yet all the sense
                                     Of eloquence

                 [PHOEBE weeps
          
                 [Enter WILFRED
          
            WILFRED   Mistress Meryll!
          
            PHOEBE    [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
                      away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.
          
            WILFRED   Haven't you anything to say to me?
          
            PHOEBE    Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
                      littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
                      in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
                      comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
                      ready for work? Ugh! you brute!
          
            WILFRED   These allusions to my professional duties are in
                      doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
                      I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
                      tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
                      can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
                      Ah! you brought that upon yourself.
          
            PHOEBE    Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
                      science and an alchemist.
          
            WILFRED   Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
                      he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
                      devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
                      fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                      Tower.
          
            PHOEBE    Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
                      take care; there's still time for a reply to his
                      petition for mercy.
          
            WILFRED   Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
                      past seven— ah! [Gesture of chopping off a head.]
          
            PHOEBE    You're a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the
                      death of a young and handsome soldier.
          
            WILFRED   Young and handsome! How do you know he's young and
                      handsome?
          
            PHOEBE    Because I've seen him every day for weeks past taking
                      his exercise on the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                      Tower.
          
            WILFRED   Curse him!
          
            PHOEBE    There, I believe you're jealous of him, now. Jealous
                      of a man I've never spoken to! Jealous of a poor soul
                      who's to die in an hour!
          
            WILFRED   I am! I'm jealous of everybody and everything. I'm
                      jealous of the very words I speak to you— because they
                      reach your ears— and I mustn't go near 'em!
          
            PHOEBE    How unjust you are! Jealous of the words you speak to
                      me! Why, you know as well as I do that I don't even
                      like them.
          
            WILFRED   You used to like 'em.
          
            PHOEBE    I used to pretend I like them. It was mere politeness
                      to comparative strangers.
          
                      [Exit PHOEBE, with spinning wheel
          
            WILFRED   I don't believe you know what jealousy is! I don't
                      believe you know how it eats into a man's heart— and
                      disorders his digestion— and turns his interior into
                      boiling lead. Oh, you are a heartless jade to trifle
                      with the delicate organization of the human interior.
          
                             No. 1A. When jealous torments
                                    (OPTIONAL SONG)
                                        Wilfred
          
            WILFRED        When jealous torments rack my soul,
                                My agonies I can't control,
                           Oh, better sit on red hot coal
                                Than love a heartless jade.
          
                           The red hot coal will hurt no doubt,
                                But red hot coals in time die out,
                           But jealousy you can not rout,
                                Its fires will never fade.
          
                           It's much less painful on the whole
                                To go and sit on red hot coal
                           'Til you're completely flayed,
                           Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                                Your wretched bones upon the rack
                           Than love a heartless jade,
                                Than love a heartless jade.
          
                           The kerchief on your neck of snow
                                I look on as a deadly foe,
                           It goeth where I dare not go
                                And stops there all day long.
          
                           The belt that holds you in its grasp
                                Is to my peace of mind a rasp,
                           It claspeth what I can not clasp,
                                Correct me if I'm wrong.
          
                           It's much less painful on the whole
                                To go and sit on red hot coal

                           The bird that breakfasts on your lip,
                                I would I had him in my grip,
                           He sippeth where I dare not sip,
                                I can't get over that.
          
                           The cat you fondle soft and sly,
                                He layeth where I dare not lie.
                           We're not on terms, that cat and I.
                                I do not like that cat.
          
                           It's much less painful on the whole
                                To go and sit on red hot coal

            2ND YEOMAN          This the autumn of our life,
                                This the evening of our day;
                           Weary we of battle strife,
                                Weary we of mortal fray.
                           But our year is not so spent,
                                And our days are not so faded,
                           But that we with one consent,
                                Were our loved land invaded,
                                     Still would face a foreign foe,
                                          As in days of long ago,
                                     Still would face a foreign foe,
                                          As in days of long ago,
                                          As in days of long ago,
                                          As in days of long ago.
          
            YEOMEN                        Still would face a foreign foe,
                                          As in days of long ago.
          
            CROWD                    Tower warders,
                                     Under orders,
                                Gallant pikemen, valiant sworders!
                                     Brave in bearing, Foemen scaring,
                                In their bygone days of daring!

                 Brave in bearing,        This the evening of our day;

                 In their bygone days of daring!
          
                 Ne'er a stranger         Weary we of battle strife,
                      There to danger
                 Each was o'er the world a ranger:
          
                 To the story             Weary we of mortal fray.
                      Of our glory
                 Each a bold,
                      A bold contributory.
          
                 To the story             This the autumn of our life.

            DAME      A good day to you!
          
            2ND
              YEOMAN  Good day, Dame Carruthers. Busy to-day?
          
            DAME      Busy, aye! the fire in the Beauchamp [pronounced
                      Bee'cham] last night has given me work enough. A dozen
                      poor prisoners— Richard Colfax, Sir Martin Byfleet,
                      Colonel Fairfax, Warren the preacher-poet, and half-a-
                      score others— all packed into one small cell, not six
                      feet square. Poor Colonel Fairfax, who's to die to-
                      day, is to be removed to no. 14 in the Cold Harbour
                      that he may have his last hour alone with his
                      confessor; and I've to see to that.
          
            2ND
              YEOMAN  Poor gentleman! He'll die bravely. I fought under him
                      two years since, and he valued his life as it were a
                      feather!
          
            PHOEBE    He's the bravest, the handsomest, and the best young
                      gentleman in England! He twice saved my father's life;
                      and it's a cruel thing, a wicked thing, and a
                      barbarous thing that so gallant a hero should lose his
                      head— for it's the handsomest head in England!
          
            DAME      For dealings with the devil. Aye! if all were beheaded
                      who dealt with him, there'd be busy things on Tower
                      Green.
          
            PHOEBE    You know very well that Colonel Fairfax is a student
                      of alchemy— nothing more, and nothing less; but this
                      wicked Tower, like a cruel giant in a fairy-tale, must
                      be fed with blood, and that blood must be the best and
                      bravest in England, or it's not good enough for the
                      old Blunderbore. Ugh!
          
            DAME      Silence, you silly girl; you know not what you say. I
                      was born in the old keep, and I've grown grey in it,
                      and, please God, I shall die and be buried in it; and
                      there's not a stone in its walls that is not as dear
                      tome as my right hand.
