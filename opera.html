                      No. 1. When maiden loves, she sits and sighs
                                (INTRODUCTION and SONG)
                                         Phoebe
          
            PHOEBE              When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                                     She wanders to and fro;
                                Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                                And to all questions she replies,
                                     With a sad "Heigh-ho!"
          
                                'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                                So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                                     An idle breath—
                                     Yet life and death
                                May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"
          
                                When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                                     As owl mopes on a tree;
                                Although she keenly feels the smart,
                                She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                                     With its sad "Ah, me!"
          
                                'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                                Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                                     Yet all the sense
                                     Of eloquence
                                Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
          
                                     Yet all the sense
                                     Of eloquence
                                Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                                     "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"
          
                                     Yet all the sense
                                     Of eloquence
                                Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
          
                 [PHOEBE weeps
          
                 [Enter WILFRED
          
            WILFRED   Mistress Meryll!
          
            PHOEBE    [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
                      away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.
          
            WILFRED   Haven't you anything to say to me?
          
            PHOEBE    Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
                      littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
                      in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
                      comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
                      ready for work? Ugh! you brute!
          
            WILFRED   These allusions to my professional duties are in
                      doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
                      I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
                      tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
                      can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
                      Ah! you brought that upon yourself.
          
            PHOEBE    Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
                      science and an alchemist.
          
            WILFRED   Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
                      he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
                      devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
                      fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                      Tower.
          
            PHOEBE    Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
                      take care; there's still time for a reply to his
                      petition for mercy.
          
            WILFRED   Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
                      past seven— ah! [Gesture of chopping off a head.]
          
            PHOEBE    You're a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the
                      death of a young and handsome soldier.
          
            WILFRED   Young and handsome! How do you know he's young and
                      handsome?
          
            PHOEBE    Because I've seen him every day for weeks past taking
                      his exercise on the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
                      Tower.
          
            WILFRED   Curse him!
          
            PHOEBE    There, I believe you're jealous of him, now. Jealous
                      of a man I've never spoken to! Jealous of a poor soul
                      who's to die in an hour!
          
            WILFRED   I am! I'm jealous of everybody and everything. I'm
                      jealous of the very words I speak to you— because they
                      reach your ears— and I mustn't go near 'em!
          
            PHOEBE    How unjust you are! Jealous of the words you speak to
                      me! Why, you know as well as I do that I don't even
                      like them.
          
            WILFRED   You used to like 'em.
          
            PHOEBE    I used to pretend I like them. It was mere politeness
                      to comparative strangers.
          
                      [Exit PHOEBE, with spinning wheel
          
            WILFRED   I don't believe you know what jealousy is! I don't
                      believe you know how it eats into a man's heart— and
                      disorders his digestion— and turns his interior into
                      boiling lead. Oh, you are a heartless jade to trifle
                      with the delicate organization of the human interior.
